AAF was the tech-centric pro football league offering a digital interactive experience allowing fans to experience the game like never before. The site offered multi-feed video streaming and paired real-time player telemetry with 3D interactivity. Standard features of a sports league website also included - stats for players, teams, league, standings, tickets, etc.

I was contacted by a previous business partner about a UX Lead role for the web product at the Alliance of American Football. He described the working experience being akin to a 4 month long hackathon. I started 6 days before the launch of the inaugural season. Operating at a hackathon pace was absolutely correct. Unfortunately for me, the awesome experience only lasted 2 months and change due to the implosion of the league that was beyond anyoneâ€™s control (except for Tom Dundon). The experience gave new meaning to working fast and being nimble for me. The new web platform was launched the night before the first game. There were 4 games every weekend. We pushed new features and updates between games, EVERY game. A newer version of the web platform was deployed on a weekly basis. It was nice to see some of the fans acknowledge that on Reddit :)
